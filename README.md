# cscStudentsAssistant
My first PHP project, also a school project I completed in 2015, we were asked to design anything useful for the department so I designed what I called a student assistant system. It is a platform where students can shear textbooks, course materials and past questions of previous academic sessions, and students can also get a list of the courses they are supposed to register for each semester and fresh student. They can also locate lecturers offices using this app
