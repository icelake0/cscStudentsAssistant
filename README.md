# cscStudentsAssistant
This is my first PHP project, and also a school project i comoleted in 2015, we were ask to designe anything usefull for the department so i designed what I called a student assistant system. It is  a platform where student can shear text book, course materials and  past questions of previous achedemic sessions, and student could also get a list of the courses they are surpose to register for each semister and fresh student can also locate lecturers offices using this app, note, this app was developed with my first few basic knowlwdge of php with less security understanding as at 2015 as at today i now program php with security at mind using frame works such as lavavel.
